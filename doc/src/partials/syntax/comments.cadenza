   <h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>  

   <p>You can insert comments into your templates by placing them between
     a left curly brace followed by a number sign '&#123;#' and a number
     sign followed by a right curly brace '#&#125;'.  The comment doesn't show 
     up in the output at all!  Here's what it looks like:</p>

   <pre>
     {{ "{# This is a comment in my template #}" }}
   </pre>
