<h3 id="render_statement">Render Statement</h3>
<p>Render statements make the job of creating very large templates much easier!
  By specifying the name of a file you'll be able to include all the contents of
  that file into your output.  On top of that the file is parsed as a cadenza
  file so any cadenza syntax you have in the file will also be evaluated.
  Here's what it looks like:</p>
  
<pre>
  {{ '{% render "partials/syntax/render_statement.cadenza" %}' }}
</pre>
