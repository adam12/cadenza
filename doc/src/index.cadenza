   <h1>Cadenza Templating Language for Ruby</h1>

   <section>
      <h2>What is Cadenza?</h2>
      <p>Cadenza is a template language for processing text in a secure
      and flexible way.  Cadenza was built with simplicity in mind, keeping the
      complexities of rendering logic as simple as possible to help those without
      a technical background grasp the essential concepts and be able to use them.</p>

      <h2>Using Cadenza: for Designers</h2>
      <p>How you use Cadenza will ultimately be determined by whoever has set
      up your environment.  </p>

      <h2>Using Cadenza: for Programmers</h2>
      <p>Cadenza is a library which can be embedded into any language which 
      supports interpreting Ruby.  This means that any framework which is built 
      on Ruby, such as Ruby on Rails or Sinatra is capable of integrating Cadenza 
      as well as languages such as Java which can make use of Cadenza through an 
      embedded interpreter like JRuby or IronRuby.</p>

      <h3>Using Cadenza with Ruby (1.9.x, 1.8.7, Ruby Enterprise Edition)</h3>
      <p>In your console run the following command</p>
      <pre>gem install cadenza</pre>

      <p>There are several ways to render your templates with Cadenza.  The 
      simplest way is via the <tt>Cadenza#render</tt> method.  Here's an example
      in your IRB console:</p>

      Ruby:
      <pre>
> require 'rubygems'
> require 'cadenza'
> Cadenza.render "Hello {{ "{{name}}" }}!", :name => "World"
=> "Hello World!"
> Cadenza.render "Hello {{ "{{name}}" }}!", :name => "from Cadenza"
=> "Hello from Cadenza!"</pre>

      <p>Pretty simple, eh?</p>

      <p>Thats the basics.  From here you'll probably want to have at the
      <a href='reference.html'>reference</a> pages to get more of an understanding
      of Cadenza.</p>
