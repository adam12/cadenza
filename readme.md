# Description

Cadenza is a template parsing and rendering library for Ruby.  The syntax is very
similar to other template languages like Django (Python), Smart (PHP), or Liquid (Ruby).

In addition to the usual template language features, Cadenza features:
* template inheritance
* extendable syntax
* interchangeable lexers, parsers, loaders and renderers
* much more

# Installation

```bash
   gem install cadenza --pre
```

# Usage

To learn how to both write Cadenza templates and use Cadenza in your Ruby 
projects have a look at the ["Cadenza Manual"](http://cadenza-manual.heroku.com/)

To learn how to extend Cadenza with custom Lexers, Parsers, Loaders and Renderers
